Growing up in Paris, I realized that despite the city's rich cultural history, I was unaware of the origins behind the names of most metro stations, which are often rooted in historical events. To address this, I developed an app that provides historical insights into Parisian metro stations. The app maps all metro locations and links each station to a description of the origin of its name, offering users a deeper understanding of the city's heritage.
