An AI Assistant designed to generate detailed investment memos from a company's URL. It analyzes all the website content to provide comprehensive insights, including key metrics such as market positioning, growth potential, and risk assessments. This tool streamlines the investment analysis process and saving time.  Through this project, I learned how to build a website, manage its front and back end, and deploy it effectively.
