As someone who doesn't have perfect pitch, I've always wanted a chord recognition system that could help me figure out the chords my favorite artists play. So, I decided to create one myself. 

This project implements a real-time chord recognition system using audio input. The system uses `librosa` for audio processing and `pyaudio` for real-time audio capture. The recognized chords are displayed along with a real-time waveform and chromatogram visualization. All code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/elieattias1/chord-recognition?tab=readme-ov-file).
