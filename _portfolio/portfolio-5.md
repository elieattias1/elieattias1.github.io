title: "Reflective Reality DJing"
excerpt: "I strongly believe in Augmented Reality's potential to revolutionize our musical experience, both for listeners and composers. I envision a future where we no longer rely on physical instruments to create music. In this project, I utilize object detection algorithms to apply audio effects to your favorite tunes, simply by moving your hands in spaceâ€”no DJ decks required. <br/><img width='660' height='415' src='/images/AR-DJ_image.png'>"

Vision : I strongly believe in Augmented Reality's potential to revolutionize our musical experience, both for listeners and composers. I envision a future where we no longer rely on physical instruments to create music.

This project combines the immersive experience of reflective reality with hand detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and real-time audio processing. The application captures video from a webcam, detects hand positions in each frame, and transforms audio based on these positions, creating an interactive and immersive VR DJ experience. The aim of this project is to pioneer a new wave of interactivity in DJing, setting the stage for a future where DJs not only play music but also dance alongside their audience, creating a more engaging and dynamic performance experience. All code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/elieattias1/AR-DJ).
