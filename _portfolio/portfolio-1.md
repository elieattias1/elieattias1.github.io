In this paper, we propose a method to simulate the effects of natural disasters on transport networks, testing the resilience of such network using percolation theory. The edges of the network represent roads (i.e. highways, primary or secondary roads, trails) while the vertices represent their in- tersection. The probability model according to which roads are susceptible to breakage are de- termined based on their proximity to the source of the earthquake and the earthquakeâ€™s features. Following percolation-like damage simulation, in which the network is sequentially susceptible to breakage, the final connectedness of the graph is analyzed. In our application, the Turkish road network was exposed to a series of earthquakes from Feb 2nd 2023 to Feb 10th 2023, located close to the Turkish-Syrian border, by the East Anatolian Fault. We found that these earthquakes resulted in a systemic divide in the graph, separating West and East Turkey. Moreover, we were able to identify recurring isolated components, which could help identify the optimal locations for emergency resource centers in future similar natural disasters.
